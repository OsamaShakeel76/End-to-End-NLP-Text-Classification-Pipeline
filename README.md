# End-to-End NLP Text Classification Pipeline

## Overview
This repository presents an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification pipeline designed to transform unstructured text into meaningful, actionable categories. The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from raw text preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference.

The pipeline is built using classical NLP techniques and supervised machine learning models, making it efficient, interpretable, and suitable for real-world applications such as customer complaint analysis, feedback categorization, and automated text routing.

## Business Context
Organizations in domains such as insurance, finance, banking, and customer support handle large volumes of unstructured textual data daily. Manually reviewing and categorizing this information is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project addresses the problem by:
- Automatically classifying text data
- Improving operational efficiency
- Enabling faster and more consistent decision-making

---

## Objectives
- Build a scalable and reusable NLP text classification pipeline
- Convert unstructured text into structured insights
- Train and evaluate supervised machine learning models
- Prepare models for real-time inference and deployment

---

## Dataset
The project uses a real-world text dataset (e.g., customer complaints or insurance-related narratives), containing:
- Free-text descriptions
- Corresponding categorical labels

Such datasets are commonly used by enterprises to analyze customer behavior and service issues.

---

## Solution Architecture
The pipeline follows a structured NLP workflow:

1. Text data ingestion  
2. Text cleaning and normalization  
3. Tokenization and preprocessing  
4. Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
5. Model training using supervised learning algorithms  
6. Model evaluation using standard classification metrics  
7. Prediction and inference readiness

## Models Used
The project implements and compares multiple models:

- **Logistic Regression**  
  - Strong baseline model for text classification  
  - Fast, interpretable, and efficient  

- **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - Captures non-linear patterns in text features  
  - Robust to noise and feature interactions  
  - Suitable for production-grade classical ML solutions  

---

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is assessed using industry-standard metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide a balanced understanding of classification effectiveness, especially in imbalanced datasets.
